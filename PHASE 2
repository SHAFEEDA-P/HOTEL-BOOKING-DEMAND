Data Cleaning and Pre-Processing

In this phase, the raw hotel booking dataset from Kaggle was cleaned and prepared for analysis. Data cleaning ensures accuracy, removes inconsistencies, and makes the dataset ready for meaningful exploratory analysis.

1. Handling Missing Values

The dataset contained missing values in several columns.
Actions performed:

Identified missing values using df.isnull().sum()

Filled numerical missing values (e.g., children) with median

Filled categorical missing values (e.g., country) with mode

Ensured no critical column remained with NaN values


2. Removing Duplicate Records

Duplicate rows were detected and removed using df.drop_duplicates().
This step prevents biased analysis and ensures dataset integrity.

3. Correcting Data Types

Some columns had incorrect or inconsistent data types.
Fixes included:

Converting date columns (e.g., reservation_status_date) to datetime format

Ensuring numerical columns were properly converted to int/float

Standardizing categorical fields


4. Creating New Derived Columns

Additional meaningful columns were created to support deeper analysis:

total_guests = adults + children + babies

total_nights = weekday nights + weekend nights


These features help in understanding guest behavior and booking patterns.

5. Filtering and Cleaning Invalid Values

Unrealistic or invalid records were removed (e.g., bookings with zero adults).
This improved the quality and reliability of the dataset.

Outcome

A fully cleaned and pre-processed dataset (hotel_bookings_cleaned.csv) ready for Phase 3 – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
