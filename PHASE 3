Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) AND Visualization.

In this phase, exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed on the cleaned hotel booking dataset to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships within the data. EDA helps understand how different factors influence hotel bookings, cancellations, customer behavior, and seasonal demand.

1. Univariate Analysis

Studied individual variables to understand distributions and data characteristics.

Examples included:

Distribution of lead time

Frequency of hotel types (City Hotel vs Resort Hotel)

Distribution of customer types

Monthly booking patterns

Cancellations vs non-cancellations


Tools used:
Histogram, bar plots, KDE plots


2. Bivariate Analysis

Explored relationships between two variables to identify trends and dependencies.

Key analyses:

Hotel type vs. cancellation rate

Lead time vs. cancellation

ADR (Average Daily Rate) vs. hotel type

Total nights vs. total cost

Market segment vs. booking patterns


Tools used:
Scatterplots, grouped bar charts, box plots



3. Multivariate Analysis

Studied interactions among multiple variables simultaneously.

Highlights:

Correlation analysis of numerical features

Heatmap to identify strong positive/negative correlations

Cancellation probability influenced by lead time, ADR, deposit type


Tools used:
Heatmap, correlation matrix

 

Visualizations:

Various plots were created using Matplotlib and Seaborn, including:

Histograms

Bar charts

Boxplots

Scatterplots

Countplots

Heatmaps

Line plots

Pie chart 


Each visualization included proper labels, titles, and insights based on observed trends.



Outcome:

The EDA revealed important insights such as:

City Hotels receive more bookings than Resort Hotels

Higher lead time strongly correlates with higher cancellation rates

ADR varies significantly between hotel types and seasons

Summer months show peak booking levels

Certain customer types and market segments contribute more to cancellations
